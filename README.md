# RapidPrototyping_Jam09
A game jam title using open-source / free art and audio assets.

## BUG LIST

- [ ] For some reason, the offered price is now being displayed as the "perfect price" after a sale. 
- [ ] A ship is being removed from rotation even if no sale is made. 
- [ ] The removed ship is still being selected during a new round, even as the visible selection is on a new ship. 
- [ ] Revenue and profits require visual correction. 
- [ ] Dealer actions are no longer counted, and boasting is (mistakenly) no longer a repeatable activity.
- [ ] Quoting a price breaks the game with a problem with some "offer panel."

## PLAYER README

It's getter tougher and tougher to make an honest spacebuck these days.

As Crazy Pete, of Crazy Pete's Space-Deals, make the most money you can selling these hunks of junk (ahem, quality spaceships) to your customers.  You know what you have in stock; the tough part is figuring out the customers.

A customer (see their "face" on the bottom left) comes to you with a list of five ships from your yard (see the right side) that they think they'd like.  Check ship stats by hovering your mouse over each one.  Stats combine to make an average or "Total Value," but the customer's preferences will crank up the worth of individual stats.

You get five actions per customer.  You can interview customers to get their top three priorities, but each time you do will lower their patience (and the price they'll accept).  If you know their priorities (or remember from the last time you sold them a ship), you can boast about ship stats to improve the apparent value.  You also can provide snacks to restore their patience, and, when you think you'll get the best deal, present them an offer.  If it doesn't work the first time, try a different price, or maybe suggest a different ship completely.  Do try not to drive them away before you can get their money . . .

It's up to you to make enough cash to cover your investment.  Ships don't just fall out of the sky, you know.
